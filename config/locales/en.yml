We created ELMO, a web and mobile-based system that allows observers to submit data using both smartphones and inexpensive mobile phones. Staff members at mission headquarters can then review the data and draw conclusions about the election. This technology places The Carter Center <a href='http://blog.cartercenter.org/2012/08/06/carter-center-on-leading-edge-of-technology-use-in-election-observation/' target='_blank'>at the leading edge</a> of technology use in election observation."

      description: "We worked with the Carter Center to overhaul their database of election obligations and standards (<a href='http://eos.cartercenter.org/' target='_blank'>EOS</a>), a compendium of information on the elements necessary for a successful democracy. EOS is used by field staff as a reference for their democracy consulting work, and is also made public so anyone can compare their country's practices to the standards of democracy defined by international bodies. We used our expertise in information architecture and modeling to clarify the underlying data structure. As a result, our design makes it simple to search and filter for authoritative sources in election law. We implemented the web application using Rails."
      vignette1: "Our expertise in information architecture and data modeling resulted in an easy to use search and filtering interface."
