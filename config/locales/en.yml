Staff members at mission headquarters can then review the data and draw conclusions about the election. This technology places The Carter Center <a href='http://blog.cartercenter.org/2012/08/06/carter-center-on-leading-edge-of-technology-use-in-election-observation/' target='_blank'>at the leading edge</a> of technology use in election observation."

We used our expertise in information architecture and modeling to clarify the underlying data structure. As a result, our design makes it simple to search and filter for authoritative sources in election law. We implemented the web application using Rails."
