  1. Voluntary and Open Membership

## Vision
1. The phrase “The revolution starts at home,” coined by INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence, underpins the values that the company strives to put into practice. We wish to create an example of an anti-oppressive workplace while also designing technologies that are tied to social justice.

1. We recognize the existence of intersectional oppression including but not limited to:
  1. patriarchy
  1. white supremacy
  1. capitalism
  1. ableism
  1. heterosexism and transphobia
  1. settler colonialism
  1. orientalism
  1. religious oppression
  1. environmental destruction

1. We understand that we are all subjects of both privilege and oppression. We strive to work non-violently against these oppressions in our everyday life. Thus, we commit to challenge and build our understanding of social justice.

1. We are in solidarity with the worker-owned cooperative movement. We recognize the need for democratic member control and economic participation. We also recognize that historically, worker-owned cooperatives are vulnerable to unchecked privileges due to the absence of hierarchy <sup>[2](#aorta-infiltration)</sup>.

1. We acknowledge that our field of technology is particularly hostile towards !((white || asian) && man) people. We will work actively to undo this oppression within our company and ourselves. We also align ourselves with organizations and people that are working to end oppression in technology. Due to this, we strive to create an environment that is accepting of white women, women of color, men of color, gender queer, and people with disabilities. Because of structural barriers, we aim to create educational programs and a variety of ways to participate in the co-op for those who do not have privilege in the tech field.

1. We strive to work on projects that do not reinforce any oppression, and optimally, projects that work against oppression.

1. We hold ourselves accountable to providing thrivable pay to all members and others who work for us and comprehensive benefits to all members.

1. We are committed to building a safe, joyful, anti-oppressive, physical space in which those who are able do most of their Sassafras work.

1. We endeavor to use open source software whenever possible. We further endeavor to contribute back to the open source community by sharing useful code and by choosing, and encouraging clients to choose, open source licenses wherever possible.

1. Provisional members shall be prepared to discuss the readings in the company reading list at the interview. This list can be found in the Operating Rules.
1. During or following the provisional membership period, any member may request an individual membership interview with the provisional member.

1. The wage earned for pro bono or sliding scale project work may be lower than the standard wage. This wage shall be determined on a project-by-project basis by the members.
