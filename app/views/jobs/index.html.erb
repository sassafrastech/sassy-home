    <h2>Working at Sassafras</h2>

    <p>Sassafras Tech Collective is a growing worker-owned technology cooperative specializing in web and application design and development for social justice organizations, nonprofits, academics, artists, and others.</p>

    <p>We are a worker cooperative, which is a business owned and democratically controlled by its workers. After a candidacy period, workers are eligible to become member-owners, which entitles them to ownership of the business and equal say regarding the direction of the business. We currently have 5 member-owners and 2 prospective members.</p>

    <p>Our team works remotely and from our office in Ann Arbor, MI. We are open to working with people who are not local to southeast Michigan.</p>

    <p>Much of our work involves consulting with nonprofits and universities to build custom web applications to meet their needs. These projects primarily have a social justice focus. We also help individuals and small nonprofits build a web presence. The software we build and use depends on the needs of our clients, but we often work with Ruby on Rails, WordPress, and Backbone.</p>
