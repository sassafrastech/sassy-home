  <h1>
    We are a growing <a href="http://techworker.coop">worker-owned technology cooperative</a> specializing
    in web/app design and development for social justice orgs, non-profits, academics, artists, and others.
  </h1>

  <h2>We deeply understand technology.</h2>

  <div class="blurb">
    <p>Bringing years of expertise from industry, academia, and social justice organizing, we understand
    the values that are embedded in code and design. Our mission is to elicit these values to make beautiful, appropriate, and easy to use technologies. In particular, we are interested in work that promotes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> sharing and solidarity economies</li>
      <li> participatory democracies </li>
      <li> healthful living </li>
      <li> environmental justice and sustainability </li>
      <li> ending oppression at the intersections of gender, race, class, sexuality, and ability </li>
      <li> community and individual empowerment </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We are a member of the <a href="http://techworker.coop/">Tech Co-op Network</a>, a network of worker cooperatives which are "businesses owned and democratically controlled by our workers." As our logo reflects, we are based in Michigan helping to bring life back into our home.</p>

She attended Jackson State University on a full ride scholarship, receiving a B.S. in Computer Science. She then entered a PhD program in Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan, but she left with a Master's after realizing she was more interested in building software than writing journal articles and dissertations. Her biggest passion is helping to build social networks that enable multiply marginalized people (like herself) to create sustaining movements which will hopefully lead to alternative economies.</p>
